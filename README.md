# Personal-Portfolio
This project is a personal CV and portfolio page built with HTML and CSS. It demonstrates my front-end skills using Flexbox, advanced CSS selectors, and responsive design. The layout is clean and modern, highlighting my background, experience, and personal projects in a structured and visually appealing way.
